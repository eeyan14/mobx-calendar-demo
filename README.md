# MobX Calendar Demo

A lil example of how MobX is set up & used in a React app, using a very (very very) simplified calendar.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). [Demo can be found here.](https://eeyan14.github.io/mobx-calendar-demo/)

## Running Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app into a deployable state and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch, which can be used by Github Pages to render the app. Requires that the repository settings are set up for Github Pages to use this branch (Settings > Pages > Branch = gh-pages @ /root folder).
